# Chatbot Project
This chatbot project is a basic rule-based conversational assistant built using Python. It is designed to handle simple, text-based interactions by matching user inputs to a predefined set of responses. The chatbot can:
Greet users and respond to common phrases
Provide a list of its capabilities
Handle unknown or malformed inputs gracefully
The code is organized into modular components for easy maintenance and extension, making it suitable for beginners learning chatbot logic.
